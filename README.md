## 📌 Project Overview
Agriculture is a major contributor to the Indian economy, yet many farmers suffer losses due to improper crop selection based on intuition rather than data.  
This project presents an **Intelligent Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning** that assists farmers in selecting the most suitable crop based on **soil properties, climatic conditions, geographical location, and economic factors**, thereby improving productivity and reducing financial risk.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Farmers often choose crops without scientific analysis of soil nutrients, rainfall, temperature, and regional conditions. This leads to low yield, financial losses, and reduced agricultural sustainability.

---

## ✅ Objectives
- Recommend the most suitable crop based on soil and climatic parameters
- Predict crop sustainability and expected yield
- Perform profit analysis using historical agricultural data
- Reduce crop failure and increase farm productivity
- Support data-driven decision making in agriculture
